## Overview of the statistical analysis:

To perform the statistical analysis I used Python with Pandas, and SQLAlchemy to filter the date column in the hawaii.sqlite database.  This allowed me to obtain the temperatures for the month of December and June.  With this information I was able to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.  

## Results:


### June Temperature Analysis

* Count 1700
* Mean 74.94
* Std 3.26
* Min 64.00
* 25% 73.00
* 50% 75.00
* 75% 77.00
* Max 85.00

## Summary:

Based on my Analysis, the business would most likely be successful in June, because it is warmer.  However there is not a huge difference in temperatures when comparing June and December, so it is possible that the business will also be successful in December. 

Including queries based on precipitation would determine how to construct the shop to be successful furing the month of June and December.
